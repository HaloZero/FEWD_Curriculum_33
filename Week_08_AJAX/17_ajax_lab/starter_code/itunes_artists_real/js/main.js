// Step 1)

// Take your previous lab solution and copy and paste it here
// All the Javascript! Clean it up so you should be only only looking at the proper code.
// Make sure that works.
// If you didn't finish the lab, finish it up for Step 1

// Step 2)

// Delete the giant JSON.
// now instead make an AJAX request to this url: "https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba"
// use the response JSON from that request to populate the page

// Step 3)
// Now the hard part. Instead of doing a request to https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=abba
// Generate the url from the value of the input box in the search box.
// I type Journey into that input and hit submit it should create the url

// https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=journey

// and do an AJAX request to that URL
// The entries should now be journey songs.

// Step 4)
// We get back more songs from the API than we have!
// Use our knowledge of creating HTML in Javascript to
// show all the songs properly. 

// Remember the basic advice is:
// Create your HTML nodes
// Append them to the appropriate spots
// Then use the original loop to modify the elements.
