Everytime you search in the search box for a specific city it should change the background of the landscape to the appropriate city. 

The cities you have to support are:

* New York City
* Austin
* LA
* San Francisco
* Syndey

Try to make your code work so that if you search common shortcuts for these cities it also works. Example: searching 'sf' should also change the city background.
