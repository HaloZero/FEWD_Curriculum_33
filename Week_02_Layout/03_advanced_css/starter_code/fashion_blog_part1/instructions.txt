Your goal is to get the HTML you have been provided to look like the image also provided using only css modifications!

1) You do not need to modify the HTML inside the <body> tag for this assignment, you should be able to do everything by modifying the css.

You can add <link> and other tags to your HTML. You should be able to replicate the image using css only.

2) It's not visible in the image but the colors of nav links change to black when you hover over them.

  Color List:
  Header Color is #D00;
  Date header colors are #CCC;

  Header Nav link color is #DDD;
  When you hover over any header navigation link the color should turn to #000;

  Title of an article is #000;
  When you hover the title of the article, it should turn to #D00;

  Paragraph text color is #444;

  Continues should be color #D00;
  When you hover over continues it should turn to #A00;

  Special Notes:
    You'll want to look into the psuedo-selector
    "::first-letter" for modifying the first letter of each paragraph in the article.
    You'll need to also apply the rule 'float: left' to make it float. We will cover this more in the next class.

3) You only need to make it look right when the browser is at most 800px wide.
