##Classes and Ids

With classes and ids, we can organize how we manipulate elements on a page.

You can add a class or an ID to any HTML tag. This can allow customized styling to that element

###Ids are unique

You add an id to an item that will only be used once on a page (headers, footers, etc). This will be important for javascript and dynamic programming.


### Classes are for organizing

You can re-use classes, you can add it to any element regardless of what tag it's applied to. This becomes handy when you want to style common things (example: buttons on a page)

HTML example

    <p class='slanted-paragraph'>
      We want text inside slanted paragraphs, to be italics
    </p>

CSS

    .slanted-pargraph {
      font-style: italic;
    }

This will make any element with the class 'slanted-paragraph' have italics font. But only those, it will not affect all paragraphs. So if you want multiple slanted paragraphs on a page, you only have to make one css rule.
