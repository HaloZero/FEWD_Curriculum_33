You will need to Google:

* background-image
* ```<del>``` ```<ins>```
* overflow
* <button>

Fonts Used:
* Source Sans Pro
* Merriweather
* Oswald

Tips and Tricks:
1) You don't want to use an img tag for the large image, use a background-image property on a div.
2) The header text should float left, the navigation should float right
3) You might find something about text-decoration color as a css property that doesn't work, it only works on Firefox. Don't use it.
