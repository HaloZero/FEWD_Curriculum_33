// Step 1: Create a function add that takes in two arguments and returns
// their sum. You can assume they're always numbers

// Step 2: Create a function sub that takes in two arguments and returns
// their difference. You can assume they're always numbers

// Step 3: Create a function max that takes in two arguments and returns
// the largest number. You can assume they're always numbers

// Step 4: Create a function min that takes in two arguments and returns
// the smallest number. You can assume they're always numbers

// Step 5: Create a function maxOf3 that takes in three arguments and returns
// the largest number. You can assume they're always numbers. You should
// utilize the max function you already created!

// Step 6: Create a function minOf3 that takes in three arguments and returns
// the smallest number. You can assume they're always numbers. You should
// utilize the min function you already created!

// Bonus
// Step 7: Create a function maxOfAll that takes in any number of arguments
// and returns the largest number. You can assume they're always numbers.
// You should utilize the max function you already created!
// This means you can pass in 2 or more arguments!
// You're hint for googling is going to be "javascript unlimited arguments"
// You'll also need to learn how to loop over an array

// Step 8: Create a function minOfAll that takes in any number of arguments
// and returns the largest number. You can assume they're always numbers.
// This means you can pass in 2 or more arguments!
// You should utilize the min function you already created!
// You're hint for googling is going to be "javascript unlimited arguments"
