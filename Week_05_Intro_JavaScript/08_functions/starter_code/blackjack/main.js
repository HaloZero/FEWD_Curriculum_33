// You have two functions available to you.

// Function 1 available to you:
// drawBotCards will return a number between 18-24 randomly.
// this should replicate a robot drawing cards aggressively to beat you
// Try this out, see what calling drawBotCards() in the console will do!

// The other function you have is 
// drawACard which will return a number representing a card
// It will always be 1-10. This should allow you to replicate drawing a card in your function

// Special caveats: Remember, in real blackjack ace can be either 1 or 11, but in this game it ONLY be 1.

// Step 1: Setup on our on click events
// Step 2: Test them, make sure your onclick events work
// Step 3: Pick a function to implement
// Step 4: Psuedocode that function
// Step 5: Implement a line from the psuedocode, 
// but don't worry about updating the HTML
// Step 6: Make sure your functions works only in JS. Use console.log!
// Step 7: Update the HTML appropriately in the spots that you need.
// Step 8: Repeat step 3-7 for each function!
